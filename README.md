# advent-of-code

## 2024

Implemented in various different languages in directory `advent2024/`.

## 2023

Implemented in various different languages in directory `advent2023/`.
To run a given day's solution, check the header comment in the source file.

## 2022

Implemented in Python in directory `advent2022/`.

## 2021

Implemented in Icarus (and later, Python) in directory `advent2021/`.

Most days' solutions will no longer work with the current head version of
https://github.com/asoffer/Icarus unfortunately.
With the latest working version, there were also the following known exceptions:

 - day02.ic has a non-deterministic type verification failure. If you try running it
   enough times, it should eventually work.
 - day03.ic part 2 isn't implemented yet.

## 2020

Implemented with Rust in directory `advent2020/`.
To run a given day's solution:

```
cargo run --bin day01
```

To run tests for all days together:

```
cargo test
```

## 2018

Implemented with Rust in directory `advent2018/`.
All days are runnable from the main binary by specifying their number on the command line:

```
cargo run 1 2 3
```
